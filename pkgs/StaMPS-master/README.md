# StaMPS - Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers

## Description
**StaMPS** is a software package that allows to extract ground displacements from time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions. The package incorporates persistent scatterer and small baseline methods plus an option to combine both approaches. It is compatible with the **TRAIN** software and therefore allows to incorporate various tropospheric correction methods in the processing workflow. 

## Installation
See the **StaMPS** manual for installation details and dependencies.

## Supported InSAR pre-processors:
- ISCE
- GAMMA
- SNAP
- DORIS + ROI_PAC

## Development
The original version was developed at Stanford University but subsequent development has taken place mainly at the University of Iceland, Delft University of Technology and the University of Leeds. In addition, there have been community contributions.
