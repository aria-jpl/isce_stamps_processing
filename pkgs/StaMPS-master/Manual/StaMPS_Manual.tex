\chapter{Introduction}

StaMPS/MTI can be downloaded from \url{http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~earahoo/stamps/} and github at \url{https://github.com/dbekaert/stamps}. The github webpage also allows to download the developers version which will be the most recent and un-released version.  \\

When using this software please reference \cite{HooperA2012}:

\textit{Hooper A; Bekaert D; Spaans K; Arikan M (2012), Recent advances in SAR interferometry time series analysis for measuring crustal deformation, Tectonophysics, 514-517, pp.1-13. doi: 10.1016/j.tecto.2011.10.013}
%\end{center}

In addition, cite dependencies used such as ISCE \citep{rosen2012}, SNAP \citep{Foumelis2018}, GAMMA \citep{Werner2000}, TRAIN \citep[e.g.][]{Bekaert2015,Bekaert2015a}. ROI\_PAC \citep{Rosen2004},  or DORIS \citep{Kampes2003}


StaMPS (Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers)  is a software package that implements an InSAR persistent scatterer (PS) method developed to work even in terrains devoid of man-made structures and/or undergoing non-steady deformation. StaMPS/MTI (Multi-Temporal InSAR) is an extended version of StaMPS that also includes a small baseline method and a combined multi-temporal InSAR method. 

This manual provides a guide to running StaMPS/MTI, but does not  explain all the processing. For some details on the inner workings, see \citet{HooperA2010b,HooperA2008,HooperA2007a,HooperA2004,HooperA2006}.
 
 A user group is also maintained at \url{http://groups.google.com/group/mainsar}. If you have a query, check the discussion threads there and, if not resolved, submit your question to the group.

\section{Development History}
The original development of StaMPS was undertaken at Stanford University, but subsequent development of StaMPS and StaMPS/MTI has taken place at the University of Iceland, Delft University of Technology, and the University of Leeds. There are also contributions from users of the package based at other institutions.

\section{Processing Overview}
Throughout this manual, commands to be entered on the command line are in \cs{blue}
and entries that are specific to the data set being processed and require modification are in \cc{red}. The presence of $>>$ before a command indicates that the command is a matlab script.\\

\subsection{Pre-processing}
There are two potential pre-processing steps before getting to the PS/MTI processing proper. The first is to focus the raw data (if required), and the second is to form interferograms from single-look complex (SLC) images. Various processors can be used to achieve the pre-processing including ISCE, SNAP, GAMMA, and ROI\_PAC and DORIS. Further details are provided in Chapter~\ref{ch:preproc} for each software.



%
%\subsection{SNAP}
%
%
%\subsection{GAMMA}
%PS/MTI processing can be done for all sensors as supported by GAMMA software. 
%
%
%\subsection{ROI\_PAC and DORIS}
%ROI\_PAC is used for the focusing and Doris for interferogram formation. If starting with SLC images, rather than raw data, the focusing step is skipped and the images are imported directly into Doris. Currently, support is provided for processing ERS, Envisat and ALOS data, if starting with raw data, and for  ERS, Envisat, RADARSAT-1/2, TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed data, if starting with SLCs. Both  ROI\_PAC and Doris processing are non-standard and various shell scripts, matlab scripts and programs are included in this package to produce interferograms that are PS/MTI friendly.

\subsection{StaMPS PS/MTI}
The PS/MTI processing itself includes C++ programs and matlab scripts  to identify coherent pixels, and to extract the deformation signal for these pixels. Typing \cs{help} followed by the name of the matlab script  provides a brief description of the processing.



\chapter{Installation}

 Install StaMPS/MTI: \\
 \cs{ tar -xvf StaMPS\_v4.1b.tar}\\
 cd StaMPS\_v4.1b/src\\
 make\\
 make install

\section{Configuration}
Edit {\tt StaMPS\_CONFIG.tcsh} or {\tt StaMPS\_CONFIG.bash} (depending on which shell you prefer to use) to point to the correct directories for your set-up (you will need additional programs installed, see below).\\
 \cs{source StaMPS\_CONFIG.}\cc{xxxx}
 \\
  This must be done whenever a new terminal is opened. You might want to add this line to your {\tt.cshrc} or {\tt.bashrc} file so that this is done automatically.
  

\section{Required packages}
 \subsection{Snaphu}
 The optimisation routines of snaphu are used by the 3-D unwrapping code and can be downloaded from:\\
  \url{http://www.stanford.edu/group/radar/softwareandlinks/sw/snaphu/}.

\section{Optional packages}
\subsection{Triangle}
The Triangle program is used for Delaunay triangulation. It is  no longer required for StaMPS Steps 1 to 7 (Chapter~\ref{ch:psproc}) but is required if users want to run Step 8. It can be found at:\\
  \url{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html}.  
  
 
\subsection{TRAIN}
The Toolbox for Reducing Atmospheric InSAR Noise (TRAIN) can be used to estimate tropospheric delays (see \citep{Bekaert2015,Bekaert2015a}). Train corrections are applied on the fly while plotting the results. Released versions can be downloaded from:\\
\url{http://www.davidbekaert.com/#links} \\
the developpers version from github at:
\url{http://github.com/dbekaert/TRAIN} \\
The help forum can be accessed at:\\
\url{http://groups.google.com/group/TRAIN_support}
  
\section{InSAR processor packages}
 Depending on the InSAR procesor being used, you will need different dependencies.
 
  \subsection{ISCE}
Details on lisence and installation of ISCE can be found at WinSAR:\\ 
 \url{https://winsar.unavco.org/software/isce} . 

\subsection{SNAP}
Details on installation and usage of the ESA SentiNel Application Platform (SNAP) can be found at \url{http://step.esa.int/main/download/} while the additional software package for the interferometric stack computation can be found at: \url{https://github.com/mdelgadoblasco/snap2stamps/}. When using this package please reference to \cite{Delgado2018}

 \subsection{Gamma}
 Gamma is a commercial software. See Gamma website for details on lisence and installation at:\\
   \url{ http://www.gamma-rs.ch/} .
   



\subsection{ROI\_PAC}
The ROI\_PAC website (\url{http://roipac.org/ROI_PAC}) is no longer active. Details on installing and running ROI\_PAC (if needed) can be found on legacy webpages and forums.\\

For ERS, ROI\_PAC requires the program getorb which must be installed in the {\tt ROI\_PAC/INT\_BIN} directory and can be downloaded from:\\ 
\url{http://www.deos.tudelft.nl/ers/precorbs/tools/getorb_pack.shtml}.

ALOS requires the latest script of {\tt make\_raw\_alos.pl}, which makes it possible to convert FBD to FBS and merge adjacent frames using the {\tt ALOS\_fbd2fbs} and {\tt ALOS\_merge} programs. These files can be downloaded from:\\
\url{http://www.roipac.org/ALOS_PALSAR}

ODR and arclist files containing the orbit information used by getorb can be downloaded from:\\ 
\url{http://www.deos.tudelft.nl/ers/precorbs/orbits/}.\\
These files should be stored in directories {\tt .../ODR/}\cc{XXXX} where \cc{XXXX} is {\tt ERS1} or {\tt ERS2}.   For Envisat data, getorb can also be used, in which case \cc{XXXX} should be {\tt Envisat}.\\
Alternatively, use the ESA DORIS (the tracking system on Envisat, not to be confused with the Doris interferometry software) orbits. Contact the ESA Help Desk (EOHelp[at]esa.int) to know where you can download these precise orbits (VOR). This is a better option at the date of writing as the ODR files have not been updated since the beginning of 2008.\\
Envisat instrument calibration files (INS) can be downloaded from:\\
\url{http://earth.eo.esa.int/services/auxiliary_data/asar/current}

\subsubsection{Data display}
 In previous versions a program called dismph was included for displaying SLCs and interferograms, but this is no longer the case. Recommended instead is xv (\url{http://www.trilon.com/xv}) or OpenEV (\url{http://fwtools.maptools.org/}).
 
\subsection{Doris}
 Details on installing Doris can be found at:\\
  \url{http://doris.tudelft.nl} .
 



 

\chapter{Pre-processing }
\label{ch:preproc}

\section{Pre-processing with ISCE}
\label{ch:isce_IFG}




Note that no shell scripts are included within the StaMPS distribution itself to generate ISCE interferograms. Users should refer to the contrib folder of the ISCE software for generating a stack compatible with StaMPS. 

Two steps are needed: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate a coregistered stack using the ISCE stack processor. This can be done using the codes included in the "contrib\/stack" folder within the ISCE software. ISCE supports a stack generation for Sentinel-1(supports SLC only), i.e. "contrib\/stack\/topsStack", and one for stripmap sensors (supports raw and SLC), i.e. "contrib\/stack\/stripmapStack". 
\item After succesfull generation of a coregistered SLC stack, use the stack to StaMPS routines provided in the ISCE contrib folder, i.e. "contrib\/timeseriesPrep\/stack2stamps", to  produce interferograms that are PS/MTI friendly.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Pre-processing with SNAP}
\label{ch:SNAP_IFG}

StaMPS is compatible with the output generated by the ESA SentiNel Application Platform (SNAP) after the version 6.0 

SNAP allows the user to define a series of xml files which contain user defined processing workflow by using its Graph Builder. These files can be used to run SNAP processing in batch mode by using the GPT command (Graph Processing Tool). 

snap2stamps contains a set of graphs, together with python wrappers that allow you to automatise the interferogram processing chain for single master interferograms compatible with StaMPS PSI.

Information about the provided functionalities and their instructions can be found in the user manual provided within snap2stamps, which already plans newer releases increasing functionality and compatibility maintenance of SNAP-StaMPS chain.


When using this software package please reference to the paper \cite{Foumelis2018} and the software \cite{Delgado2018}.




The following steps are needed and provided by snap2stamps: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort the slave images in separated folders corresponding to their acquisition time.
\item Slave splitting (and slice assembling if needed) and anotated orbits replacement with Precise/Restituted Orbits.
\item Coregistration and interferogram generation done per slave and subswath. Here auxiliary files as DEMs and subset using a bounding box is performed.
Both amplitude coregistered master-slave stack and interferogram with elevation and orthorectified latitude and longitude coordinates are saved as output.
\item StaMPS export is done providing for each pair coregistered stack and interferogram generated StaMPS compatible products.

\end{enumerate}





\section{Pre-processing with Gamma}  
\label{ch:gamma_IFG}
A specific directory structure needs to be created within a processing directory (which itself can have any name) using exactly the naming standards below, which is different for PS and small baseline processing.


\subsection{PS processing}
A series of interferograms all with the same master need to be formed. The following files are needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item  {\tt ./rslc/}\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt .rslc}\\ a resampled SLC for every slave and unresampled slc for the master
\item   {\tt ./rslc/}\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt .slc.par}\\ the SLC parameter file for the master
\item   {\tt ./diff0/}\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt.diff}\\ an interferogram for every slave image
\item   {\tt ./diff0/}\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt.base} \\ a base file for every interferogram
\item  {\tt ./geo}/\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt \_dem.rdc} \\ the DEM in master radar coordinates
\item  {\tt ./geo}/\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt.lon}\\ the longitude of every pixel in the master SLC
\item  {\tt ./geo}/\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt.lat}\\ the latitude of every pixel in the master SLC
  %geo/*.diff\_par the parameter file 
    %dem/*\_seg.par
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Small Baseline Processing}
A connected network of interferograms should be formed from SLCs that are all coregistered with a single image (super-master). The following files are needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item  {\tt ./SMALL\_BASELINES/}\cc{yyyymmdd\_yyyymmdd/yyyymmdd}{\tt .rslc}\\
a resampled SLC for the master image in every interferogram
\item  {\tt ./SMALL\_BASELINES/}\cc{yyyymmdd\_yyyymmdd/yyyymmdd}{\tt .rslc}\\
a resampled SLC for the slave image in every interferogram
\item  {\tt ./SMALL\_BASELINES/}\cc{yyyymmdd\_yyyymmdd/yyyymmdd}{\tt .rslc.par}\\
the SLC parameter file for the super-master
\item  {\tt ./SMALL\_BASELINES/}\cc{yyyymmdd\_yyyymmdd/yyyymmdd\_yyyymmdd}{\tt .diff}\\
the interferograms
\item  {\tt ./SMALL\_BASELINES/}\cc{yyyymmdd\_yyyymmdd/yyyymmdd\_yyyymmdd}{\tt .base}\\
a base file for every interferogram
\item  {\tt ./geo}/\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt \_dem.rdc} \\ the DEM in super-master radar coordinates
\item  {\tt ./geo}/\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt.lon}\\ the longitude of every pixel in the super-master SLC
\item  {\tt ./geo}/\cc{yyyymmdd}{\tt.lat}\\ the latitude of every pixel in the super-master SLC
%   geo/*diff\_par
  % dem/*\_seg.par
\end{itemize}

\section{Pre-processing with ROI\_PAC and DORIS} 
\label{ch:roipac_doris_IFG}
\subsection{Create SLCs from Raw (using ROI\_PAC)}

Support is provided for raw data from ERS, Envisat  and ALOS satellites only.



{\em If you are starting with SLC data rather than raw data, skip this section.}




 Scripts have been updated to run with ROI\_PAC version 2.3 or 3.0. If you have the ROI\_PAC version 2.2 installed, you should run the versions of the SLC generation scripts with the suffix \cs{\_V2.2} attached.


\cs{link\_raw }   \cc{ data\_path }   \cc{ processing\_path}
(where \cc{data\_path} is the FULL path to your source data and \cc{processing\_path} is the FULL path to a new processing directory you have created)

This will create a directory named {\tt SLC} in the \cc{processing\_path} directory, with a subdirectory for each image named \cc{yyyymmdd}. Within each subdirectory, symbolic links will be created to the data files. For ERS data the link names are  {\tt IMAGERY}\cc{yyymmdd} and {\tt SARLEADER}\cc{yyyymmdd} (\underline{4 digit, not 2 digit, years}), and for Envisat and ALOS data, the link names are the same as the original names. 

 In your processing directory:\\
 \cs{mkdir SLC}\\
 \cs{cd SLC}\\
 %\cs{cp \$MY\_SCR/roi.proc .}\\
 \cs{mkdir} \cc{yyyymmdd}
 for each scene and within this directory create symbolic links to the raw data (and leader files if they exist). For ERS data the link names must be {\tt IMAGERY}\cc{yyymmdd} and {\tt SARLEADER}\cc{yyyymmdd} (\underline{be sure to use 4 digit, not 2 digit, years}), but for Envisat and ALOS data the link names should be the same as the original names.
 


 

 Choose a master based on minimising perpendicular, Doppler and temporal baselines (see \citet{HooperA2007a}). If you do not know the baseline data, choose a preliminary master based only on time and follow this manual as far as the {\tt make\_coarse} step in Section \ref{sec:ifgs}. After running {\tt make\_coarse}, the script {\tt master\_select} can be used to calculate expected stack coherence. Alternatively, one can enter \cs{grep Bperp */coreg.out} in the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} directory to see the perpendicular baselines with respect to the selected master (enter \cs{grep f\_DC\_con */slave.res} in the {\tt SLC} directory for the Doppler centroids). A new master can then be picked if necessary. If this is the case, edit {\tt master\_crop.in} for the new master, run \cs{step\_master\_setup},  then go directly to Section \ref{sec:ifgs}.
 
 
 Substitute your chosen master date in the format {\tt yyyymmdd} wherever \cc{master\_date} appears below.





 From the SLC directory:

Choose your region of interest and note the first/last azimuth lines and first/last range pixels. You should try to pick an area that is included in all the slave images too, which may not be the case if you choose an area too close to the image edge. Multiply the line numbers by the number of azimuth looks and the pixel numbers by the number of range looks to get line/pixel numbers referenced to the SLC.

 It may become apparent later that one or more scenes are offset from the master by so much that the focused image does not include the entire cropped master image.

Edit {\tt make\_slcs.list} to leave only scenes that need recreating and run \cs{make\_slcs\_}\cc{XXXX}. 


\subsection{Reading/cropping SLCs  from Level 1 products}

{\em If you created SLCs with ROI\_PAC using raw data, skip this section.}

Currently, scripts exist for (reading and cropping single look complex (SLC) products from ERS, Envisat, RADARSAT-1/2, TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed satellites.

In your processing directory, for example, under /d2/iceland\_volcanoes/\\
\cs{link\_slcs }   \cc{ data\_path }  
(where \cc{data\_path} is the FULL path to your source data )

This will create a directory named {\tt SLC} in the current directory, with a subdirectory for each image named \cc{yyyymmdd}. Within each subdirectory, symbolic links will be created to the slc files (and leader/volume files if they exist). For ERS and RADARSAT-1 data the link names must be {\tt DAT\_01.001}, {\tt  LEA\_01.001}, and {\tt VDF\_DAT.001}. For Envisat and COSMO-SkyMed data the link name must be {\tt image.slc}. For TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 data, the link names must be {\tt image.slc} and {\tt leader.xml}. \\


Choose a master based on minimising perpendicular, Doppler and temporal baselines (see \citet{HooperA2007a}). Substitute your master date in the format {\tt yyyymmdd} wherever \cc{master\_date} appears below.


 \cs{cd} \cc{master\_date}\\
 \cs{step\_read\_whole\_}\cc{XXX} (where \cc{XXX} is `\cs{ERS}', `\cs{Envisat}', `\cs{RSAT}', `\cs{RSAT2}', `\cs{TSX}', or `\cs{CSK}')
 
 Take note of the number of range looks.
 
 %\cs{dismph image.slc.}\cc{X}\cs{looks.raw} \cc{1294 } (range looks, multilooked filewidth) or 
 \cs{eog image.slc\_}\cc{X}\cs{l.ras}

 If your system does not have eog, an alternative image viewer which support Sun raster files will work as well.
 
\subsubsection{\label{sec:slcread1} Option 1: Specify by latitude and longitude}
edit {\tt master\_crop\_geo.in} in the SLC directory, and specify your area of interest.  

\cs{cd} \cc{master\_date}\\
\cs{step\_master\_read\_geo\\
cd ..\\
make\_read\_geo}
 
\subsubsection{\label{sec:slcread2}Option 2: Specify by line/pixel number}
Choose area of interest and note first/last azimuth line and first/last range pixel. You should try to pick an area that is included in all the slave images too, which may not be the case if you choose an area too close to the image edge. Multiply the line numbers by the number of azimuth looks and the pixel numbers by the number of range looks to get numbers referenced to the SLC. 
%Generally you should be at least 1000 lines in azimuth and 40 pixels in range from the edges, but even this may not be enough. 



 \cs{cp \$MY\_SCR/master\_crop.in .}\\
 Edit {\tt master\_crop.in}
and update the crop area. {\tt first\_l} and {\tt last\_l} are the first and last azimuth line numbers, {\tt first\_p} and {\tt last\_p} are the first and last range pixels.
%If the last digits of {\tt last\_l} \& {\tt last\_p} are equal to the last digits of {\tt first\_l} \& {\tt first\_p} plus 9, the length and width will be round numbers

 \cs{step\_master\_read}

 %!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode\cs{vi make\_slcs.list} and remove the entry for \cc{master\_date}\\

 This will read and crop SLCs from all directories listed in {\tt make\_slcs.list}, which by default contains all SLC directories except the master date.\\

\subsection{\label{sec:ovs} Oversampling SLC data (Optional)}

After focusing your RAW data or reading/cropping your SLCs, optionally, you can oversample your dataset using Doris. If no oversampling needs to be applied ship this section and proceed to section \ref{sec:ifgs}.

In your processing directory, for example, under /d2/iceland\_volcanoes/\\
 \cs{cd SLC}\\
 \cs{cd} \cc{master\_date}\\
 \cs{step\_master\_ovs}

 \cs{cd ..} (back to SLC directory)\\
 \cs{make\_ovs}\\
 This will oversample SLCs from all directories listed in {\tt make\_slcs.list}, which by default contains all SLC directories except the master date.

By default, oversampling is done with a factor of 2 in both range and azimuth directions. You can change this by editing {\tt master\_ovs.dorisin} and {\tt ovsfiles.dorisin} in the  {\tt SLC} directory
%by copying files {\tt master\_ovs.dorisin} and {\tt ovsfiles.dorisin} to {\tt SLC} directory.\\
%  cp {\tt \$DORIS\_SCR/master\_ovs.dorisin} {\tt SLC/}\\
%  cp {\tt \$DORIS\_SCR/ovsfiles.dorisin} {\tt SLC/}
%and then edit the parameters listed under oversampling section on each file.
Then re-run \cs{step\_master\_ovs} and \cs{make\_ovs} to create a new oversampled dataset.

%add some tips in the future

 For a single master approach, oversampling shows significant improvement in PS density especially in the rural areas
(see \cite{Sousa2011} and \citet{Arikan2010}).

\subsection{\label{sec:ifgs} Create IFGs (using DORIS)}


 In the same directory where SLC and INSAR\_\cc{master\_date} reside:\\
 \cs{mkdir DEM}



 Place your DEM in this directory. 





\cs{cd INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date}

 If the SLCs were not created by ROI\_PAC create a file named {\tt dummy.slc.rsc}
with the following line (substituting the correct heading, to the nearest degree is fine):\\
 {\tt HEADING \ \ \ \cc{-167}}

 For TerraSAR-X, the value can be found  in leader.xml, and can be extracted automatically using
 \cs{tsx\_extract\_heading} (you must have python installed to run this). If you linked SLCs using \cs{link\_slcs} master heading is automatically extracted as image.slc.rsc and later copied to \cs{INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} as \cc{master\_date}.slc.rsc.

 \cs{step\_master\_orbit\_ODR} (only run if using precise ODR orbits)


 edit {\tt timing.dorisin} and update the following fields based on the DEM you are using:
 


{\tt SAM\_IN\_FORMAT  \cc{real4}\\
 SAM\_IN\_DEM\ \ \ \  \cc{/data/T156/DEM/dem\_data.flt}\\
 SAM\_IN\_SIZE\ \ \  \cc{4801 4801}\ \  // rows cols\\
 SAM\_IN\_DELTA\ \  \cc{0.000833333 0.000833333}\ \  // posting in degrees\\
 SAM\_IN\_UL\ \  \ \ \  \cc{13 42}\ \ // lat and lon of upper left\\
 SAM\_IN\_NODATA\   \cc{-9999}}







 \cs{step\_master\_timing} 


 This step can be run alongside \cs{make\_orbits}, \cs{make\_coarse} and \cs{make\_coreg}.
 This step was new in version 3.1, and replaces the former StaMPS codes for DEM offset correction with new code in  Doris v4.0. Offsets are calculated for 30 (by default) different windows, which are printed to the screen at the end. Check that the selected offsets are consistent with the mode values of for the windows. If not, change the number of windows in {\tt timing.dorisin} to a higher number, comment out the {\tt M\_SIMAMP} process and rerun the step. If still not successful, delete the output from the timing step in master.res in the INSAR\_\cc{master\_date} directory and \underline{ALL subdirectories}, and calculate the DEM offset manually (see Section \ref{sec:calcdem}). 


\begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}\textbf{Tip: } 
 \cs{step\_master\_timing}  calculates the master timing error, which is used for extracting the  height from the correct position in the DEM, and geocoding. Non-precise timing information will cause geocoding to assign  an inaccurate position to the pixels. The reliability of the estimated timing error mostly depends on the DEM. For example, it is not advisable to run this step if the topography of an area is flat and the DEM does not contain information about building heights. In this case, 
 \cs{step\_master\_timing} can be skipped, or you can try and calculate the DEM offset manually (see Section \ref{sec:calcdem}). You still need to edit {\tt timing.dorisin} however if you intend to run {\tt make\_dems} later.
\end{small}

 \vspace{0.5mm}

}
\end{center}


 %\cs{$\backslash$ls -d ../SLC/[1,2]* $>$ slcs.list}
 %(N.B. If the SLC directories are not in the same directory as INSAR\_\cc{master\_date}, the full path must be given)\\
 %\cs{vi slcs.list}
 %and remove \cc{master\_date}\\
 
 \subsubsection{Bulk Processing}
 
 In the INSAR\_\cc{master\_date} directory:
 
\cs{make\_orbits}

This creates a subdirectory for each slave image. The default is to treat all images in the SLC directory except the master as slave images. If a different set of slave images is required, create a file named {\tt slcs.list} listing the directories containing the images you wish to include, before running {\tt make\_orbits}. Precise orbits are extracted from the ODR files if they are found (ERS and Envisat only).

\begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}\textbf{Tip:} 
 \cs{show\_porbits}   will let you verify the result of \cs{make\_orbits} by indicating NUMBER\_OF\_DATAPOINTS successfully extracted the ODR files. precise\_orbits equal 0 indicate that no precise orbits found in the specifed ODR directory. Either check the ODR path in the doris input file in the slave directory or remove that SLC date from the slcs.list.

\end{small}

 \vspace{0.5mm}
\end{minipage}
}
\end{center}

\cs{make\_coarse}

This creates a {\tt coreg.out} file in each slave subdirectory. The last 32 lines of each {\tt coreg.out} file is output to the terminal at the end.  Check the following values for each {\tt coreg.out} file:

{\tt Coarse\_correlation\_translation\_lines:  \cc{-76}\\
 Coarse\_correlation\_translation\_pixels: \cc{-1}}


 These values should be approximately the modal values from the data below them. If this is not the case and the values are wrong by more than a couple of pixels, you should edit the relevant {\tt coreg.out} file and correct the values. 
 
Optionally, you can also check that the master crop is included within each slave image (only the parts of the master crop that are in ALL slaves will be considered in the later times series processing). Look for the highest and lowest values of {\tt Coarse\_correlation\_translation\_lines} and 
 {\tt Coarse\_correlation\_translation\_pixels}. Add the translations to the master crop range (in {\tt master.res}) and make sure the corresponding slave crop contains the translated values (in {\tt slave.res}). If not, you should adjust either the master crop or the relevant slave crops. If you adjust the master crop, it is easiest to delete the whole {\tt INSAR\_\cs{master\_date}} directory and recreate it with \cs{step\_master\_setup} (raw data) or \cs{step\_master\_read}/\cs{step\_master\_read\_geo} (CEOS SLC data). If you adjust slave crops (by rerunning  \cs{step\_slc\_}\cc{XXX} or \cs{step\_read}), you need run \cs{step\_orbit} in the slave subdirectory only for those slaves that have been adjusted.  
  
 It may also be the case that there is a timing error in the orbit info and the approximate values in {\tt \_Start\_coarse\_orbits} are too far from the real values for coarse correlation to work. In this case, estimate the coarse offsets yourself (look at the SLCs), update them in {\tt \_Start\_coarse\_orbits} in {\tt coreg.out} and rerun just the Doris {\tt COARSECORR} step.




 \cs{make\_coreg}
 (long runtime) or \cs{make\_coreg\_simple}

{\tt make\_coreg} coregisters all images with baseline $<$ 100 m directly to the master and coregisters those with larger baselines  to the 3 closest slave images with a smaller baseline. These default values can be changed by copying {\tt \$STAMPS/bin/make\_coreg} to {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date}, editing the values at the top and running \cs{./make\_coreg}.
 
 {\tt make\_coreg\_simple} coregisters all images directly to the master. It therefore runs quicker than {\tt make\_coreg} but may fail in some instances for large baselines.
 
If rerunning, {\tt make\_coreg}
 does not re-coregister scenes that have already been processed. If this is required, delete the corresponding {\tt CPM\_Data.}\cc{n1}.\cc{n2} files in the coreg subdirectory, where \cc{n1} and \cc{n2} refer to the order of the two coregistered scenes in {\tt make\_coreg.list} ({\tt 0} for the master), or delete the entire {\tt coreg} subdirectory to re-coregister all scenes.


Also by default, all cross-correlations with coherence greater than {\tt 0.3} are selected initially by Doris. If there is generally good coherence, this value can be increased (by editing {\tt coreg.dorisin} in the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} directory)  to make run times faster or, if coherence is particularly bad, the value can be decreased, though any cross-correlation with coherence below {\tt 0.12} is usually never correct.

When {\tt make\_coreg} has finished, check the size of the {\tt CPM\_Data} files in the {\tt coreg} directory (\cs{ls -l CPM\_Data*}). View any which are around 1000 bytes or less, and if there are 12 lines or less, delete the file, as the coregistration for this pair has failed. After deletion, the inversion step must be rerun by entering \cs{update\_coreg} within the {\tt INSAR\_\cc{master\_date}/coreg} directory. Note that if all {\tt CPM\_Data} files associated with a particular slave are deleted, then there is a problem with that slave image, e.g. it is badly focused. Resolve the problem, then rerun \cs{make\_coreg} to recreate the {\tt CPM\_Data} files for this slave.




 \cs{make\_dems}
 (long runtime - can run alongside {\tt make\_coreg}). If the area being processed has insignificant topography, this step can be skipped.
 
 \cs{make\_resample}

 After running, check the sizes of  the resampled SLC images (\cs{ls -l */*.slc}). They should be all identical. For any that differ, the slave crop does not include the entire master crop, probably due to a problem with coregistration for that slave. After resolving the problem(s), run \cs{step\_resample} in the slave subdirectory for the problem slaves only.
 %(see discussion under make\_coarse above). Correct this by either altering the master crop and deleting the entire INSAR\_\cc{master\_date} directory or by altering the relevant slave crops and then for each of them rerunning step\_orbit, step\_coarse, make\_coreg (after deleting the relevant CPM\_Data) and step\_resample.
 
  %or \cs{make\_filtazi\_resample}
 %The former does not filter in azimuth, and is the recommended approach for PS processing. The latter filters in azimuth before resampling.\\
 
 \cs{make\_ifgs} or  \cs{make\_ifgs\_nodem} (run the latter if you skipped {\tt make\_dems})
 
 \cs{xv */*dem\_\cc{X}l.ras} (\cc{X} is number of range looks)
 and check that each interferogram looks OK (i.e., the amplitude looks reasonable and there is at least a little coherence apparent in the phase)


Geocoded coordinates are needed in subsequent PS processing. To calculate the latitude and longitude of each pixel, run the next command in \ul{only one} of the slave directories.

 \cs{step\_geo}
 




\subsubsection{\label{sec:calcdem}Manual DEM offset correction}

This step need only be run if {\tt step\_master\_timing} failed. It should be run after {\tt make\_coarse} and before {\tt make\_dems}.
%

 Choose a slave close in time and space. In the \cc{yyyymmdd} subdirectory for the chosen slave:\\
 \cs{step\_coreg\\
 step\_dem} (can be run alongside step\_coreg)\\
 \cs{step\_resample\\
 step\_ifg}
 
 \cs{matlab -nojvm -nosplash}\\
$>>$\cs{calc\_dem\_offset}\\
This estimates the offset of the DEM range slope from the interferogram amplitude and displays the best-fitting result (DEM slope in blue, amplitude in red). Check that the offset is reasonable by zooming in on a few places. If not use $>>$\cs{plot\_amp\_dem(}\cc{dem\_down,dem\_right}\cs{)} to adjust the offsets in azimuth and range until a better fit is achieved. 

You can adjust \cc{red\_contrast}
and \cc{blue\_brightness}
 (default 0.5 and 1) to vary contrast between amplitude image and DEM (see $>>$\cs{help plot\_amp\_dem})

 
Once happy with the fit, update the values for M\_RG\_T\_ERROR   and M\_AZ\_T\_ERROR  in dem.dorisin and geocode.dorisin (in the INSAR\_\cc{master\_date} directory), by adding the values output by calc\_dem\_offset or plot\_amp\_dem.






 %In the \cc{yyyymmdd} directory:\\
 %\cs{step\_dem}\\
 % \cs{matlab -nojvm -nosplash}\\
%$>>$\cs{plot\_amp\_dem} and check that the fit is correct. If you are not happy with the fit and make further adjustments, you must add the output values for M\_RG\_T\_ERROR   and M\_AZ\_T\_ERROR to the values already set in dem.dorisin and geocode.dorisin.

%\section{Geocode}
%
%
% In one slave directory only run:\\

% (calculates the latitude and longitude of each pixel)




\subsubsection{Re-running Steps}


 \cs{make\_orbits }
processes all images listed in {\tt slcs.list}. Delete {\tt slcs.list} to process all slave SLC images in the main {\tt SLC} directory.

\cs{make\_coarse}
processes all slave subdirectories in {\tt make\_ifgs.list}. Delete {\tt make\_ifgs.list} to process all subdirectories containing a {\tt slave.res} file.

 \cs{make\_dems, make\_resample and make\_ifgs}
process all slave directories in {\tt make\_ifgs.list}. Delete {\tt make\_ifgs.list} to process all directories containing a {\tt coreg.out} file.


\cs{make\_coreg }
processes all slave subdirectories listed in {\tt make\_coreg.list} (in the {\tt coreg} subdirectory), which is initially a copy from {\tt make\_ifgs.list}. Extra images can be added to the bottom of this file, but no lines should ever be deleted, as {\tt n1} and {\tt n2} in the {\tt CPM\_Data.n1.n2} files refer to the order of the files listed in {\tt make\_coreg.list}.



 The following individual steps can be rerun in the individual \cc{yyyymmdd} subdirectories of {INSAR\_\cc{master\_date}}:\\ 
  \cs{step\_orbit}
  extracts orbit info.\\
   \cs{step\_coarse}
   coregisters  coarsely.\\
 \cs{step\_coreg }
coregisters the slave image directly to the master (may be different to results from {\tt make\_coreg} which includes slave-slave coregistration).\\
  \cs{step\_resample}
resamples the slave image.\\
  \cs{step\_dem}
 creates the simulated dem interferogram.\\ 
 \cs{step\_ifg}
 creates the final interferogram.


 


\subsubsection{Possible reasons for Doris SIGERV error}


\begin{itemize}


 \item {\tt master.res} or {\tt slave.res} (as specified in the {\tt .dorisin} file being run) is missing


 \item orbits are missing from {\tt master.res} or {\tt slave.res}

\item 
 higher order coefficients in coregpm are too large - makes resampling impossible


 \item slave SLC doesn't overlap the master cropped SLC. 
 %See discussion above on recreating the SLC using ROI\_PAC. 


\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Disk Space}


Many intermediate files are produced and disk space requirements are therefore large (approximately 12.5 GB per image, if the whole image area is processed). Once step 1 of {\tt stamps} matlab script has been run, the following may be run in {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} to free up space (only easily recreatable files are deleted):


\cs{make\_clean\_ifgs }
To recreate the files deleted by this script, run \cs{make\_ifgs} in the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date}  directory.



 \cs{make\_clean\_resample }
To recreate the files deleted by this script, run \cs{make\_resample} in the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date}  directory.

\cs{make\_clean\_raw} (if you created SLCs using ROI\_PAC). To recreate files deleted by this script, run \cs{make\_slcs\_}\cc{XXXX} in the {\tt SLC} directory.
 


\chapter{PS Processing}
\label{ch:psproc}
First, create single master interferograms by following the pre-processing Section of your preferred InSAR processor in Chapter~\ref{ch:preproc} .

In the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} directory run
 \cs{mt\_prep\_isce} for ISCE,  \cs{mt\_prep\_snap} for SNAP, \cs{mt\_prep\_gamma} for GAMMA or \cs{mt\_prep}  for DORIS   . For example:  \\
 \cs{mt\_prep} \cc{0.4 3 2 50 200} where
 
 %\begin{list}{}
 \begin{tabular}{rll}
 \cc{0.4} &= &amplitude dispersion (0.4-0.42 are reasonable values)\\
 \cc{3} &= &number of patches in range (default 1)\\
\cc{2}& =&number of patches in azimuth, (default 1)\\
\cc{50} &= &overlapping pixels between patches in range (default 50)\\
 \cc{200} &= &overlapping pixels between patches in azimuth (default 200)\\
\end{tabular}
%\end{list}




 The number of patches you choose will depend on the size of your area and the memory on your computer. Generally, patches containing $<$ 5 million SLC pixels are OK.




The parameters that control the processing are set to default values which you can view with:\\
  \cs{matlab}\\
   $>$$>$\cs{getparm}
 %(refer to \citet{HooperA2007a} for the meaning of many of the parameters).
 
 
 You can modify any parameters from the default using \\
   $>$$>$\cs{setparm(`}\cc{param\_name}\cs{',}\cc{param\_value}\cs{)}\\
   Only enough characters of \cc{param\_name} to make it unique are required. Setting \cc{param\_value} to {\tt nan} resets the parameter to the default value.


 $>$$>$\cs{stamps}



 The default is to run all steps. A subset of steps can also be selected, see $>$$>$\cs{help stamps}
 for details.
 
 Steps 1 to 5 run by default on individual patches after which the patches are merged into one. Steps 6 to 8 run by default on the merged patch. It is also possible (though not recommended) to run steps 6 to 8 on individual patches by setting the {\tt patch\_flag} to {\tt `y'}, e.g.,\\
 $>>$\cs{stamps(6,8,`y')}
 
 Once Step 1 has been run you can run $>>$\cs{ps\_info} to list brief information for each of the interferograms included.

\section{Step 1: Load data} 
Converts the data into the formats required for PS processing and stores them in matlab workspaces.

\section{Step 2: Estimate phase noise}
This is an iterative step that estimates the phase noise value for each candidate pixel in every interferogram. Processing is controlled by the following parameters:
\footnotesize

\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}p{1.8cm}p{8.5cm}}
\textbf{Parameter Name} &	\textbf{Default} & \textbf{Description}\\

{\tt max\_topo\_err} &	 {\tt 5} &		Maximum uncorrelated DEM error (in m). Pixels with uncorrelated DEM error greater than this will not be picked (this includes error due to the phase center of the resolution element being offset from the middle of the pixel in range).
Setting this higher, however,  increases the mean $\gamma$ value (coherence-like measure, see \citet{HooperA2007a}) of pixels that have random phase.\\
{\tt filter\_grid\_size} &		 {\tt 50} &		Pixel size of grid (in m). Candidate pixels are resampled to a grid with this spacing before filtering to determine the spatially-correlated phase.\\
{\tt filter\_weighting} &		{\tt  `P-square'} &		Weighting scheme (PS probability squared), the other possibility being {\tt `SNR'}. Candidate pixels are weighted during resampling according to this scheme.\\
{\tt clap\_win} &		 {\tt 32} &		CLAP (Combined Low-pass and Adaptive Phase) filter window size \citep{HooperA2007a}. Together with {\tt filter\_grid\_size}, determines the area included in the spatially-correlated phase estimation.\\
{\tt clap\_low\_pass\_wavelength} &		 {\tt 800} &		CLAP filter low-pass contribution cut-off spatial wavelength (in m). Wavelengths longer than this are passed.\\
{\tt clap\_alpha} &		 {\tt 1} &		CLAP $\alpha$ term. Together with the $\beta$ term, determines the relative contribution of the low-pass and adaptive phase elements to the CLAP filter.\\
{\tt clap\_beta} &		 {\tt 0.3} &		CLAP $\beta$ term\\
{\tt gamma\_change\_convergence} &		 {\tt 0.005} &		Threshold for change in change in mean value of $\gamma$ (coherence-like measure). Determines when convergence is reached and iteration ceases.\\
{\tt gamma\_max\_iterations} &		 {\tt 3} &		Maximum number of iterations before iteration process ceases.\\
\
\end{tabular}
\normalsize

\section{Step 3: PS selection}
Pixels are selected on the basis of their noise characteristics. This step also estimates the percentage of random (non-PS) pixels in a scene from which the density per km$^2$ can be obtained. Processing is controlled by the following parameters:

\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}p{1.8cm}p{8.5cm}}
\textbf{Parameter Name} &	\textbf{Default} & \textbf{Description}\\

{\tt select\_method} &
	 {\tt `DENSITY'} &	Other option {\tt `PERCENT'}. 
	 \\
{\tt density\_rand} &
	 {\tt 20} &	 Maximum acceptable spatial density (per km$^2$) of selected pixels with random phase. Only applies if {\tt select\_method} is set to {\tt `DENSITY'}. At this stage we can usually accept a high density, as most random-phase pixels will be dropped in the next step.\\
{\tt percent\_rand} &
	 {\tt 20} &	Maximum acceptable percentage of selected pixels with random phase. Only applies if {\tt select\_method} is set to {\tt `PERCENT'} \\ 
{\tt drop\_ifg\_index} &
	 {\tt []} & Interferograms listed here (by order number given in $>>$\cs{ps\_info}) will not be included in the selection calculations.	 \\		 
\
\end{tabular}
\normalsize

\section{Step 4: PS weeding}

Pixels selected in the previous step are weeded, dropping those that are due to signal contribution from neighbouring ground resolution elements and those deemed too noisy.  Data for the selected pixels are stored in new workspaces.  Processing is controlled by the following parameters:

\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}p{1.8cm}p{8.5cm}}
\textbf{Parameter Name} &	\textbf{Default} & \textbf{Description}\\
%{\tt weed\_alpha} &	 {\tt 8} &	Smoothing parameter for estimating phase noise distribution for each pair of neighbouring pixels. The time series phase for each pair is smoothed using a Gaussian window with standard deviation 1/{\tt weed\_alpha}. The original phase minus the smoothed phase is assumed to be noise.\\
 {\tt weed\_standard\_dev} &	 {\tt 1.0} &	Threshold standard deviation. For each pixel, the phase noise standard deviation for all pixel pairs including the pixel is calculated, If the minimum standard deviation is greater than the threshold, the pixel is dropped. If set to {\tt 10}, no noise-based weeding is performed\\
 {\tt weed\_max\_noise} &	 {\tt Inf} &	Threshold for the maximum noise allowed for a pixel. For each pixel the minimum pixel-pair noise is estimated per interferogram. Pixels whose maximum interferogram noise value is higher than the indicated threshold are dropped. \\
 {\tt weed\_time\_win} &	 {\tt 730} &	Smoothing window (in days) for estimating phase noise distribution for each pair of neighbouring pixels. The time series phase for each pair is smoothed using a Gaussian-weighted piecewise linear fit.  {\tt weed\_time\_win} specifies the standard deviation of the Gaussian. The original phase minus the smoothed phase is assumed to be noise. \\
 {\tt drop\_ifg\_index} &
	 {\tt []} & Interferograms listed here (by order number given in $>>$\cs{ps\_info}) will not be included in the weeding calculations.	 \\
\
\end{tabular}
\normalsize



\section{Step 5: Phase correction}

The wrapped phase of the selected pixels is corrected for spatially-uncorrelated look angle (DEM) error. At the end of this step the patches are merged. Processing is controlled by the following parameters:


\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}p{1.8cm}p{8.5cm}}
\textbf{Parameter Name} &	\textbf{Default} & \textbf{Description}\\
{\tt merge\_resample\_size} &	 {\tt 0} & Coarser posting (in m) to resample to. If set to {\tt 0}, no resampling is applied.\\
{\tt merge\_standard\_dev} &	 {\tt inf} & Threshold standard deviation. For each resampled pixel, the phase noise standard deviation is computed. If the standard deviation is greater than the threshold, the resampled pixel is dropped. Only applied in case of resampling.\\
 \end{tabular}
\normalsize

If your merged results contain so many PS pixels  that your computer has memory issues, consider setting {\tt merge\_resample\_size} to a higher number, which will result in coarser sampling.

\begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}
Check the wrapped phase of the selected pixels after running this step, e.g.,\\
 $>>$\cs{ps\_plot(`w')} 

In terms of reprocessing, the first parameter to play with is {\tt weed\_standard\_dev}. If it looks like too many noisy pixels are being chosen, the value can be reduced. If very few pixels are chosen, the value can be increased. 

If still too few pixels are being selected such that any signal is generally undersampled, variation of Step 3 parameters can be tried. The number of initial candidates can also be increased by setting the amplitude dispersion higher in {\tt mt\_prep}.\end{small}

 \section{Step 6: Phase unwrapping}
Processing is controlled by the following parameters:
 
 \footnotesize
\begin{tabular}[ht!]{p{4.5cm}p{1.8cm}p{8.5cm}}
\textbf{Parameter Name} &	\textbf{Default} & \textbf{Description}\\
{\tt unwrap\_method} &	 {\tt `3D'} &  Unwrapping method. \\
{\tt unwrap\_prefilter\_flag} &  {\tt `y'} & Prefilter phase before unwrapping to reduce noise. Other option (not generally recommended) {\tt `n'}.\\
{\tt unwrap\_patch\_phase} &  {\tt `n'} & Use the patch phase from Step 3 as prefiltered phase. If set to {\tt `n'} (recommended), PS phase is filtered using a Goldstein adaptive phase filter.\\
{\tt unwrap\_grid\_size} & 200 & Resampling grid spacing. If {\tt unwrap\_prefilter\_flag} is set to {\tt `y'}, phase is resampled to a grid with this spacing.\\
{\tt unwrap\_gold\_n\_win}	 & 32	& Window size for Goldstein filter.\\
{\tt unwrap\_time\_win}	& 730 & Smoothing window (in days) for estimating phase noise distribution for each pair of neighbouring pixels. The time series phase for each pair is smoothed using a Gaussian window with standard deviation of this size. Original phase minus smoothed phase is assumed to be noise, which is used for determining probability of a phase jump between the pair in each interferogram.\\
{\tt unwrap\_gold\_alpha}	 & 0.8	& Value of $\alpha$ for Goldstein filter.\\
 {\tt drop\_ifg\_index} &
	 {\tt []} & Interferograms listed here (by order number given in $>>$\cs{ps\_info}) will not be unwrapped.	 \\
 {\tt subtr\_tropo} &
	 {\tt `n'} & When set to {\tt `y'}, removes an estimate before unwrapping as defined using the correction in {\tt tropo\_method}. Note, this is to ease the unwrapping process, thus after unwrapping the tropospheric signals are added back in. \\	 
	{\tt tropo\_method} &
	 {\tt `a\_l'} & Type of tropospheric correction that will be used to remove the tropospheric delays when {\tt subtr\_tropo} is set to  {\tt `y'}. Valid options are those supported by TRAIN (e.g. `a\_l', `a\_e', `a\_w', `a\_m', etc). \\	  
\end{tabular}
\normalsize
 
 Note that if re-running Step 6 and Step 7 has been run, estimates of SCLA and master atmosphere and orbit error (AOE) will be subtracted before unwrapping. If you do not wish this to occur, reset these estimates before running Step 6 with\\
 $>>$\cs{scla\_reset}
 
(This subtraction of SCLA and master AOE has not however been implemented with the {\tt unwrap\_prefilter\_flag} = {\tt `n'} option.)
 
\begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}

After running step 6, display the output with\\
$>>$\cs{ps\_plot(`u')}

Check for unwrapping errors i.e., phase jumps in space which are uncorrelated in time. Pay attention to the color scale. It may help to set it to a narrower range, e.g., $[-2\pi , 2\pi]$ (see plotting options in chapter \ref{ch:plotting}).
 Unwrapping errors are more likely to occur in longer perpendicular baseline interferograms. This is for two reasons, firstly there is more noise associated with each PS pixel, and secondly, the phase due to any spatially-correlated look angle (SCLA) error is larger, as it is proportional to perpendicular baseline. Noise is reduced by spatial filtering before unwrapping, but it is also possible to reduce the SCLA error phase by estimating the SCLA error from the interferograms that have been unwrapped OK by running Step 7. If Step 6 is re-run after Step 7 has been run, the SCLA error phase is temporarily subtracted from the wrapped phase before unwrapping. The unwrapping accuracy is further improved by also temporarily subtracting the atmosphere and orbit error (AOE) phase of the master image, present in all the interferograms, which is also estimated in Step 7.
\end{small}
 \vspace{0.5mm}

\end{center}






\section{Step 7: Estimate spatially-correlated look angle error}

Spatially-uncorrelated look angle (SULA) error was calculated in Step 3 and removed in Step 5. In Step 7, spatially-correlated look angle (SCLA) error is calculated which is due almost exclusively to spatially-correlated DEM error (this includes error in the DEM itself, and incorrect mapping of the DEM into radar co-ordinates). Master atmosphere and orbit error (AOE) phase is estimated simultaneously. 
  
 Processing is controlled by the following parameters:

 \footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}p{1.8cm}p{8.5cm}}
\textbf{Parameter Name} &	\textbf{Default} & \textbf{Description}\\
{\tt scla\_drop\_index} &	 {\tt []}	&  Interferograms listed here (by order number given in $>>$\cs{ps\_info}) will not be included in the SCLA calculations, but will still be included in Step 6 and previous steps.\\
{\tt scla\_deramp} &	 {\tt `n'}	& If set to {\tt `y'}, a phase ramp is estimated for each interferogram.\\
 {\tt drop\_ifg\_index} &
	 {\tt []} & Interferograms listed here (by order number given in $>>$\cs{ps\_info}) will not be included in the SCLA calculations, nor will they be included in Step 6 and previous steps.	 \\
	  {\tt subtr\_tropo} &
	 {\tt `n'} & When set to {\tt `y'}, removes an estimate of the tropospheric delay as defined using the correction in {\tt tropo\_method} prior to the computation of the SCLA error. \\	 
	{\tt tropo\_method} &
	 {\tt `a\_l'} & Type of tropospheric correction that will be used to remove the tropospheric delays when {\tt subtr\_tropo} is set to  {\tt `y'}. Valid options are those supported by TRAIN (e.g. `a\_l', `a\_e', `a\_w', `a\_m', etc). \\	
\end{tabular}
\normalsize

Display the estimate of SCLA error with\\
$>>$\cs{ps\_plot(`d')} 
Units are phase per m of perpendicular baseline, with 0.01 radians/m corresponding to about 12 m of DEM error for the Envisat I2 swath. You can use $>>$\cs{K2q} to  do the conversion for ERS, Envisat I2 swath or ALOS.

Display the estimate of master atmosphere and orbit error (AOE) phase  with\\
$>>$\cs{ps\_plot(`m')}

Display the phase ramps (if  {\tt scla\_deramp} is set to {\tt `y'}) with\\
$>>$\cs{ps\_plot(`o')}

Unwrapped phase minus one of, or a combination of the above can be plotted with \cs{`u-d'}, \cs{`u-m'}, \cs{`u-o'}, \cs{`u-dm'}, \cs{`u-do'},  or \cs{`u-dmo'}. 



\begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}

After running Step 7, check that the estimates seem reasonable, i.e., $>>$\cs{ps\_plot(`u-dm')} looks generally smoother than $>>$\cs{ps\_plot(`u')} (note that the default colour scales will be different). If not generally smoother, one or more interferograms have probably been incorrectly unwrapped  (usually those with large perpendicular baselines). Identify those  that appear incorrectly unwrapped, add them to {\tt scla\_drop\_index} and rerun Step 7, e.g., to drop the 13th and 14th interferograms,

$>>$\cs{setparm(`scla\_d',[}\cc{13:14}\cs{])}\\
$>>$\cs{stamps(7,7)}\\

A list of interferograms with baselines greater than, for instance, 400~m can be retrieved with\\
$>>$\cs{[bperp,index]=ps\_baselines(}\cc{400}\cs{)}\\

If you want to assess any change in your results after reruning Step 7, you can save your figures, e.g.,\\
$>>$\cs{ps-plot(`d',-1)}\\
will save as a {\tt .mat} file the results of calculating  the option {\tt `d'}.\\

Once happy that all included interferograms are generally smoother, rerun Step 6. 
Step 6 will subtract the estimates of SCLA and master AOE before unwrapping (as long as {\tt unwrap\_prefilter\_flag} = {\tt `y'}), and add them back in afterwards . If more interferograms become reliably unwrapped on re-running, remove them from {\tt scla\_drop\_index} before re-running Step 7. This can be repeated until all interferograms are reliably unwrapped, or until no further improvement is seen.

\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}

If there is \textbf{non-steady deformation} present in some interferograms and, by chance, it correlates with perpendicular baseline, it can get mapped into the SCLA error. This may be evidenced as propagation of any deformation  in \cs{ps\_plot(`u-dm')}to all interferograms (though the sign for each will depend on the perpendicular baseline sign), or correlation of \cs{ps\_plot(`d')} with \cs{ps\_plot(`m')}. If you suspect this is occurring, you can attempt to remove the deformation/baseline correlation by adding or subtracting interferograms to {\tt scla\_drop\_index}. Note that \textbf{time and baseline info} can be displayed with\\
$>>$\cs{ps\_info}\\

If some interferograms are still not reliably unwrapped, 
%try setting {\tt unwrap\_patch\_phase} to `n' and rerunning Step 6. This will use the filtered phase of the PS pixels only, rather than that derived in Step 3 for unwrapping. 
try increasing {\tt unwrap\_grid\_size} to 200 m or more. This will \textbf{reduce the effects of noise} by smoothing more, but do not set it higher than the distance over which you expect deformation phase to vary by about $\pi/2$.  Another thing to try is dropping noisier pixels by setting {\tt weed\_standard\_dev} to a lower value, and re-running from Step 4, or increasing {\tt merge\_resample\_size} (and/or reducing {\tt merge\_standard\_dev}) and rerunning from Step 5.

\chapter{Small Baseline Processing}
First, create single master interferograms by following the pre-processing chapter of the InSAR processor applied, i.e. chapter ~\ref{ch:roipac_doris_IFG} for ROI\_PAC/DORIS, chapter ~\ref{ch:isce_IFG} for ISCE or chapter ~\ref{ch:gamma_IFG} for Gamma. Note, the steps below are for DORIS and Gamma. The processing steps for ISCE up to the \cs{mt\_prep\_isce} are different and detailed in chapter ~\ref{ch:isce_IFG}. Note, SNAP currently does not support Small Basline processing with StaMPS.

For Gamma and DORIS, if PS processing has not been run, in the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} directory load baseline info into matlab workspaces with:\\
 \cs{mt\_extract\_info}\\
 \cs{matlab}\\
 $>>$\cs{ps\_load\_info}
 
 To determine which small baseline interferograms to make, in the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} directory run:\\
  \cs{matlab}\\
 $>>$\cs{sb\_find (rho\_min , Ddiff\_max , Bdiff\_max)}\\
Adjust the input parameters according to your data set, where \cs{rho\_min} is the minimum coherence based on the maximum temporal \cs{Ddiff\_max} and perpendicular \cs{Bdiff\_max} decorrelated baselines. There should be no isolated clusters of images. More connections can be made by reducing {\tt rho\_min}, or individual connections can be added by editing {\tt small\_baselines.list}, which is created by {\tt sb\_find}. The connections in {\tt small\_baselines.list} can then be plotted with:\\
$>>$\cs{plot\_sb\_baselines}. 
 
 To create the small baseline interferograms listed in {\tt small\_baselines.list} in the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} directory, run:\\
 \cs{make\_small\_baselines}.\\ 
If the Doppler centroid is high, Doris may fail when filtering in azimuth. You can skip azimuth filtering with\\ 
 \cs{make\_small\_baselines 1}\\ 
 Range filtering may also be skipped with\\ 
  \cs{make\_small\_baselines 1 1} 

 The script  \cs{make\_small\_baselines} will create a new subdirectory called {\tt SMALL\_BASELINES} within the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} directory, containing a subdirectory for each small baseline interferogram.
 
 
 
 
 Within the {\tt SMALL\_BASELINES} directory run  
 \cs{mt\_prep}  for ROI\_PAC/DORIS,  \cs{mt\_prep\_gamma} for Gamma,   \cs{mt\_prep\_isce} for ISCE. For example:\\
\cs{mt\_prep} \cc{0.6 3 2 50 200} where
 

\begin{tabular}{llp{8.5cm}}
 \cc{0.6} &= &amplitude difference dispersion (0.6 is reasonable)\\
 \cc{3} &= &number of patches in range (default 1)\\
\cc{2}& =&number of patches in azimuth, (default 1)\\
\cc{50} &= &overlapping pixels between patches in range (default 50)\\
 \cc{200} &= &overlapping pixels between patches in azimuth (default 200)\\
\end{tabular}


Note that the first parameter is amplitude {\em difference} dispersion rather than amplitude dispersion as used for PS processing, and a higher value should be given, e.g., 0.6.
 
 
\section{Step 1-5} 
 As for PS processing, small baseline MTI processing is controlled by various parameters that can be modified with $>>$\cs{setparm} and processing is initiated with\\
  \cs{matlab}\\
 $>>$\cs{stamps}
When running this process, the amount of the computer load is probably much higher than  during PS processing. This may cause the program to stop due PC memory limitations. If this is the case, the number of patches should be increased, then rerun \cs{mt\_prep}. In general patch sizes smaller $<$ 4 million SLC pixels are OK.

For small baselines processing, some of the parameters have different default values compared to PS processing:\\
\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}p{1.8cm}p{8.5cm}}
\textbf{Parameter Name} &	\textbf{Default} & \textbf{Description}\\
{\tt select\_method} &
	 {\tt `DENSITY'} &	Other option {\tt `PERCENT'}. \\
{\tt density\_rand} &
	 {\tt 2} &	 Maximum acceptable spatial density (per km$^2$) of selected pixels with random phase. Only applies if {\tt select\_method} is set to {\tt `DENSITY'}.\\
{\tt percent\_rand} &
	 {\tt 1} &	Maximum acceptable percentage of selected pixels with random phase. Only applies if {\tt select\_method} is set to {\tt `PERCENT'} \\ 
 {\tt weed\_standard\_dev} &	 {\tt inf} &	Threshold standard deviation. For each pixel, the phase noise standard deviation for all pixel pairs including the pixel is calculated, If the minimum standard deviation is greater than the threshold, the pixel is dropped. If set to {\tt 10}, no noise-based weeding is performed\\
{\tt unwrap\_method} &	 {\tt `3D\_QUICK'} &  Unwrapping method. \textbf{****MORE options need to be included and explained, ref to a paper?****} \\
{\tt merge\_resample\_size} &	 {\tt 100} & Coarser posting (in m) to resample to. If set to {\tt 0}, no resampling is applied.\\

\section{Step 6: Phase unwrapping}
Step 6 includes extra processing after phase-unwrapping to retrieve the phase with respect to the original master by least-squares inversion. An additional parameter, {\tt unwrap\_hold\_good\_values}, is introduced for the unwrapping of the the Small Baseline network. \\

	 {\tt `a\_l'} & Type of tropospheric correction that will be used to remove the tropospheric delays when {\tt subtr\_tropo} is set to  {\tt `y'}. Valid options are those supported by TRAIN (e.g. `a\_l', `a\_e', `a\_w', `a\_m', etc). \\

First, unwrap the full small baseline network once with {\tt unwrap\_hold\_good\_values } set to the default `n'. Then set {\tt unwrap\_hold\_good\_values} to `y' and re-run the unwrapping with any small changes, e.g. change the  {\tt unwrap\_grid\_size}, or drop particularly bad interferograms, see other parameters listed above. Subsequent unwrapping iterations, with changes in parameter values or interferograms, will fix all pixels in each interferogram that were unwrapped correctly in the previous iteration and only change pixels involved in unwrapping errors.\\

You can \textbf{manually fix regional unwrapping errors} by running $>>$\cs{sb\_fix\_unwrap\_manual}. First a `rsb' plot will be generated from your currently unwrapped dataset, after which you are asked which interferogram you want to correct. Start with the interferogram which shows the largest spatial unwrapping error. Note that it can occur that an unwrapping error happens within another region. Type the interferogram number on the command line and hit enter. This will generate the `rsb' plot for the specific interferogram, for which you can define a polygon of the unwrapping error by clicking on the figure. Press enter once you defined the polygon to continue. You will now be prompted on the number of integer 2$\pi$ cycles that should be removed (positive or negative number). After hitting enter this will re-run the sb inversion, and generate an updated 'rsb' plot. You will be able to iterate your correction till the unwrapping error disappears from the `rsb' plot. You can re-set you unwrapped results to the initial unwrapped interferograms by calling  $>>$\cs{sb\_fix\_unwrap\_manual(1)}. Note that when re-running step 6, you results will be overwritten. \\
In case your small baseline interferograms had their perpendicular baseline estimated for each individual interferogram (e.g. gamma), ramp like features can appear in `rsb'. If this is the cases, set `deramp\_flag=1' in the function sb\_fix\_unwrap\_manual.m.\\

\section{Step 7: Estimate spatially-correlated look angle error}

 
 Step 7 includes extra processing to calculate the SCLA error from both small baseline and single master interferograms.
Step 7 is controlled by the following parameters:

\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}p{1.8cm}p{8.5cm}}
\textbf{Parameter Name} &	\textbf{Default} & \textbf{Description}\\
{\tt sb\_scla\_drop\_index} &	 {\tt []}	& SB Interferograms listed here (by order number given in $>>$\cs{sb\_info}) will not be included in the SCLA calculations, but will still be included in Step 6 and previous steps.\\
{\tt scla\_drop\_index} &	 {\tt []}	&  Interferograms listed here (by order number given in $>>$\cs{ps\_info}) will not be included in the single master SCLA calculations.\\
{\tt scla\_deramp} &	 {\tt `n'}	& If set to {\tt `y'}, a phase ramp is estimated for each interferogram.\\
 {\tt drop\_ifg\_index} &
	 {\tt []} & SB Interferograms listed here (by order number given in $>>$\cs{ps\_info}) will not be included in the SCLA calculations, nor will they be included in Step 6 and previous steps.	 \\
 \end{tabular} 
 \normalsize
 
 \begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}

 As for PS processing, repeating Step 6 after running Step 7 may improve phase-unwrapping accuracy. Accuracy can also potentially be improved by setting {\tt unwrap\_method} to {\tt `3D'} (default is {\tt `3D\_QUICK'} for small baseline processing) before running Step 6, although this will take longer to run.
 
 Unwrapped phase of small baseline interferograms can be viewed using \cs{ps\_plot} with the \cs{`usb'} options. SCLA error estimated from SB inteferograms can be plotted using the \cs{`d'} option (the \cs{'D'} option will give SCLA error estimated from single master interferograms). Residuals between the unwrapped phase of the small baseline interferograms and that predicted from the model values for the single master phase can be plotted with the \cs{`rsb'} option.
 
 The residuals for each small baseline interferogram should be visually inspected, together with the wrapped and unwrapped phase for each (N.B., you will probably want to view only a few at a time using the {\tt IFG\_LIST} option of \cs{ps\_plot}) . Isolated residuals less than $\pi$ in magnitude are OK, but spatially-correlated residuals indicate an unwrapping problem in one or more interferograms. When this is the case, identify which interferogram(s) are incorrectly unwrapped (N.B., one badly unwrapped interferogram can cause non-zero residuals for many interferograms) and drop them from the unwrapping process, by setting {\tt drop\_ifg\_index} and rerunning Step 6.  
 
 You can view a baseline plot for all interferograms not dropped with \cs{plot\_sb\_baselines}.

\end{center}

  \begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}
 Once there are no more spatially-correlated residuals, check the unwrapped phase of each of the  interferograms with \cs{ps\_plot(`usb-d')}. If there is non-steady deformation present in some interferograms and, by chance, it correlates with perpendicular baseline, it can get mapped into the SCLA error. This may be evidenced as propagation of any deformation  in \cs{ps\_plot(`usb-d')}to all interferograms (though the sign for each will depend on the perpendicular baseline sign). If you suspect this is occurring, you can attempt to remove the deformation/baseline correlation by adding or subtracting interferograms to {\tt sb\_scla\_drop\_index}. Note that time and baseline info can be displayed with $>>$\cs{sb\_info}.

\end{center}

  \begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}
If you are interested in the time series (not just mean velocities) you should also check the unwrapped phase of each of the single master interferograms with \cs{ps\_plot(`u-dm')}. If there is non-steady deformation present in some interferograms and, by chance, it correlates with perpendicular baseline, it can also get mapped into the SCLA error. This may be evidenced as propagation of any deformation  in \cs{ps\_plot(`u-dm')}to all interferograms (though the sign for each will depend on the perpendicular baseline sign), or correlation of \cs{ps\_plot(`D')} with \cs{ps\_plot(`m')}. If you suspect this is occurring, you can attempt to remove the deformation/baseline correlation by adding or subtracting interferograms to {\tt scla\_drop\_index}. Note that time and baseline info can be displayed with $>>$\cs{ps\_info}.

\chapter{Combined MTI Processing}

Pixels selected by both PS and small baseline methods can be combined after Step 5 has completed for both methods. Data can be combined either for the whole area or for an individual patch, depending on whether you are in the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} directory or one of the {\tt PATCH\_}\cc{X} subdirectories. Run\\ 
$>>$\cs{ps\_sb\_merge}

This will create a new subdirectory {\tt MERGED} in the {\tt INSAR\_}\cc{master\_date} directory, and a {\tt PATCH\_}\cc{X} subdirectory within this, if you are merging only an individual patch.

For Step 6 onwards, processing is the same as for small baseline processing

\chapter{Plotting}
\label{ch:plotting}

\subsubsection*{Overview scripts}

 The following matlab scripts can be used to plot the data in various ways (use $>>$\cs{help} in matlab to see all options):
 
\begin{tabular}{lm{5cm}m{5cm}}
Matlab command & Description & Options \\
\hline
$>>$\cs{plot\_all\_ifgs} & Plots all multilooked interferograms &\\ 

$>>$\cs{ps\_plot} & Plots values for each selected pixel, on various backgrounds, for chosen interferograms & value type, background, phase limits, reference ifg, ifg list, $n_{x}$, colorbar flag, textsize, textcolor, longitude and latitude range, individual pixel selection\\ 

$>>$\cs{ps\_plot\_ifg} &  Plots a value for each selected pixel, on various backgrounds & phase, background, color map limits, longitude and latitude range \\

\end{tabular} 

To change the size of the square representing each selected SLC pixel (default 120 m) change the {\tt plot\_scatterer\_size} parameter, e.g.,\\
$>>$\cs{setparm(`plot\_s',200)}

The resolution of the background (for {\tt bg\_flag} of 0 or 1) is set by default to be 3 times finer than {\tt plot\_scatterer\_size}. You can change this by updating {\tt plot\_pixels\_scatterer}. The resolution for plots on the DEM is controlled by {\tt plot\_dem\_posting}.

You can select a \textbf{reference area} by setting parameters {\tt ref\_lon} and {\tt ref\_lat} (for a rectangular area) or {\tt ref\_centre\_lonlat} and {\tt ref\_radius} (for a circular area). All plots will then be referenced to the mean value for this area. If not set, the reference value is the mean value for the whole area.

Normal \textbf{phase sign conventions} apply: if the master predates the slave, positive phase implies movement {\em away} from the satellite.

For plotting of \textbf{velocities}, the units are mm/year with positive values being {\em towards} the satellite (in versions prior to v3.1, the sign convention for  velocity was the opposite).

Data is \textbf{output to ascii} files with\\
$>>$\cs{ps\_output} 
  
\cs{plot\_v.gmt} can then be run to plot \textbf{mean LOS velocities on the DEM in shaded relief}, using GMT. Copy (from {\tt \$STAMPS/bin}) and edit the script to adjust plotting parameters.

\subsubsection*{Time series plots}

 $>>$\cs{ps\_plot(`v-d',1,0,0,[}\cc{1:3,7:8}\cs{],}\cc{`ts'}\cs{)} 
 plots the mean LOS velocity, calculated from single master interferograms for PS processing, or small baseline interferograms for SB and combined processing. The \textbf{`ts'} switch enables the user to select individual points for generating time series (TS) plots. \\
 \\
 Initially, mouse input is activated to select a point on the velocity plot which is defined by \textbf{`v-d'} switch. Later, using the \textbf{`new TS plot'} button, you can define additional new points for the TS plot. You can change \textbf{`radius factor'} in the white text box to search in a larger radius, unless you can't find points with the default factor (search radius = radius factor * radius, where radius is 1 arcsecond by default).\\
\\
 Another example:\\
\cs{ ps\_plot('v-d',1,0,0,[], 0, 0, 0,[], [28.6 28.9], [41.2 41.27],'ts')} plots velocities for the subset defined by longitude and latitude, and generates TS plots, the rest of the switches are set to default values.

\begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}

\textbf{Tip}: The position of \textbf{`ts'} switch could be anywhere after plot option \textbf{`v-d`}. For details type \cs{ps\_plot} without any arguments on the matlab prompt to get help. 

\end{small}

 \vspace{0.5mm}
\end{minipage}
}
\end{center}
Using the {\tt `V-D'} option (rather than {\tt `v-d'}) forces the use of single master interferograms for the estimation, even for SB or combined processing
\subsubsection*{Google earth KML file}

 $>>$\cs{ps\_gescatter(`project\_velo.kml',ph\_disp,10,0.4)}, using gescatter.m will generates a kml file from ph\_disp matrix for every 10 points with an opacity of 0.4. Later, you can load the \textbf{`project\_velo.kml'} file to google earth for visualisation. 
 
\begin{center}
\colorbox{notegray}{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\begin{small}

\textbf{Tip}: Use $>>$\cs{ps\_plot(`v-d',-1)} to save PS velocity estimation to a mat file and later retrieve with $>>$\cs{load ps\_plot\_v-d  ph\_disp} command and use as an input to \textbf{ps\_gescatter}.\\

\end{small}
