# TRAIN
The Toolbox for Reducing Atmospheric InSAR Noise – TRAIN – is developed in an effort to include current state of the art tropospheric correction methods into the default InSAR processing chain. Initial development was performed at the University of Leeds. The toolbox consists of a combination of command line scripts, shell scripts, and matlab scripts. More information on software is provided in Chapter 3. TRAIN is independent of the used InSAR processor, as long as the data convention is followed. The toolbox is compatible with the StaMPS software. Further initial efforts have been put to include TRAIN into the default -rate processing chain.
