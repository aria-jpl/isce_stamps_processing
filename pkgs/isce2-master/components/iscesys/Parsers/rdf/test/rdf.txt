Testing possible unit adding grammar (TBD) using elemet (though UNIT verb would work)
Pa       [unit] = 1             ! define base unit
psi (Pa) [unit] = 6894.75729    ! define target unit



x_km (km) {length}    =     0.001   ! x in km
x_m (m)      = 1                  ! x in m
x_nm (nm) = 1e9                   ! x in nm

t_sec (s) {time} = 3600      ! t in seconds
t_hour (hour) = 1            ! t in hours
t_min (min) = 60



Following line test for error condition
OPERATOR = 

y = 2

Folloing lines change a reserved glyph and put the system to the test
COMMENT = %
z34 = 34 % z = 134
COMMENT = !

Following line is a grammar error with regards to the Bracket class
error1 ) ( = 10

Following line sets a prefix, and test the affix protocol
PREFIX = one_


level = 0

Now get recursive
INCLUDE =  rdf2.txt
SUFFIX = _1

b = -2
a = -1

Three errors are next
error2 ( ] = 20
error3 (()) = 20
error4 { = cx


Cancel affixes
PREFIX =
SUFFIX = 
Change the equals sign
OPERATOR = %

end1 % one
end2 % two

Enough of that
OPERATOR % =

end3 = 1 2 3 4      ! cast to string
end4 = 1, 2, 3, 4   ! cast to tuple with ','


end5 = 1; 2; 3; 4   # cast to string, unless we TBD change ',' to ';'
end6 = 1; 2; 3; 4   ! cast to string, unless we TBD change ',' to ';'



Note: the following line makes no-sense
OPERATOR = !
You need 3 lines to swap those glyphs
OPERATOR = %
COMMENT % =
OPERATOR % !

flipped_value (am) {length} ! 3.14159 = Now the comment
SEP = 	;  ! SEP is not in the lexicon, but it  could be
z = 2
