To use the TOPS or Stripmap stack processors you need to:

1- Install ISCE as usual
2- Depending on which stack processor you need to try, add the path of the folder containing the python scripts to your $PATH environment variable as follows:
   - to use the topsStack for processing a stack of Sentinel-1 tops data add the full path of your "contrib/stack/topsStack" to your $PATH environemnt variable
   - to use the stripmapStack for processing a stack of Stripmap data, add the full path of your "contrib/stack/stripmapStack" to your $PATH environemnt variableu 

NOTE:

   The stack processors do not show up in the install directory of your isce software. They can be found in the isce source directory. 

Important Note:

   There might be conflicts between topsStack and stripmapStack scripts (due to comman names of different scripts). Therefore users MUST only have the path of one stack processor in their $PATH environment at a time, to avoid conflicts between the two stack processors.
