    This is an example XML input used by topsOffsetApp.py, which is used if a
    topsOffsetApp.xml file is located within the directory that topsOffsetApp
    is run.

    There are four important things to note about the usage of topsOffsetApp.py:

        1. topsApp.py MUST BE RUN up to (at least) the 'fineresamp' step to
            generate the correct products/metadata to run topsOffsetApp.py.

        2. Since topsOffsetApp.py essentially extends topsApp.py, the version of
            topsApp.xml that was used to run the topsApp.py steps must stay the
            same when running topsOffsetApp.py (i.e. do not alter topsApp.xml
            between running topsApp.py and topsOffsetApp.py).

        3. As with other applications in ISCE, the list of Parameters that are
            configurable by this topsOffsetApp.xml are listed in
            topsOffsetApp.py. In general these parameters pertain to running
            the DenseAmpcor module, however some are there to store values for
            use later in the app. These values will have a note (in general) in
            the docstring denoting "overridden by workflow" and the app will
            overwrite any configuration set by the user.

        4. Because a majority of the critical metadata is calculated in
            topsApp.py, a topsOffsetApp.xml is *not necessary* to actually run
            topsOffsetApp.py with the default values listed in topsOffsetApp.py.
