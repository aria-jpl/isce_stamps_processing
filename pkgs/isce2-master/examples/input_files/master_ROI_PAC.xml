<!-- Shown above is the bare minimum input XML file for ROI_PAC sensor. The master and slave catalog xml files have the same structure.

All file paths in the input files should either be absolute paths or relative to the processing directory.


    Note 1: Inputs
    ===============

    ROI_PAC sensor is used to read in raw data that was generated using JPL's ROI_PAC software. Note that there is no "OUTPUT" tag for this sensor. The raw file is directly ingested by ISCE. It is also assumed that the rsc file associated with the RAWFILE is available in the same directory. The following three files are read in by ISCE:

    rawfile       (RAWFILE tag)        -> raw file generated by ROI_PAC
    rawfile.rsc                        -> rsc file for the raw data generated by ROI_PAC
    hdr_data_points.rsc (HDRFILE tag)  -> orbit file generated by ROI_PAC. 


    Note 2: More frequent orbit samples
    ===================================

    For geometric accuracy, ISCE performs best when the available state vectors are 10-30 seconds apart. Users may have to modify their ROI_PAC make_raw scripts to generate appropriate hdr orbit files with good temporal sampling. This is particularly needed when dealing with raw data generated by stitching multiple frames.

    Note 3: ROI_PAC Metadata inconsistencies
    ========================================

    ROI_PAC generated inconsistent values for XMIN tag for raw.rsc . If your data has header bytes in front of it; make sure that XMIN tag is set to the number of header bytes (this needs to be an even number).

    Note 4: Links to RAW file
    ==========================

    If you plan to process stacks using this Sensor object, ensure that you link the source raw file into the working directory and point to the link in the insarApp.xml / catalog files. This is because all other sensors create a RAW file in the working directory and this file name is used to derive SLC names. If you point to a RAW file that is not located in the working directory, the SLCs will also be generated in the same directory as RAW files. For stack processing this will cause the SLCs to be overwritten by each run.
