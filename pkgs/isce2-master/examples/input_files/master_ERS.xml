<!-- Shown above is the bare minimum input XML file for ERS sensor. The master and slave catalog xml files have the same structure.

    All file paths in the input files should either be absolute paths or relative to the processing directory.

    Note 1: Orbits
    ================

    ISCE can handle ODR, PRC and PDS orbits for ERS data. These data should be packaged into a directory with appropriate arcinfo files (same format as ROI_PAC). If the user wants to use a specific orbit file, one can directly specify the file using the following XML structure
    <property name="ORBIT_FILE">
        <value>filepath</value>
    </property>

    Note 2: File naming conventions
    ================================

    ISCE does not enforce strict naming conventions for the image and leader files like ROI_PAC. File names are treated like any other strings and the names are not used for metadata parsing.

    Note 3: Multiple frames
    ========================
    ISCE can automatically stitch multiple raw data frames before focusing them. Modify your image file and leader file entries should be provided as lists as follows:

    <property name="IMAGEFILE">
        <value>['data/IMAGERY1','data/IMAGERY2']</value>
    </property>
    <property name="LEADERFILE">
        <value>['data/LEADER1','data/LEADER2']</value>
    </property>

    The entries for image file and leader file should match up, i.e, entry 1 in imagefile list should correspond to entry 1 in leaderfile list.

    Note 4: Doppler Centroid
    =========================
    ERS raw data leaders do not include any doppler centroid information. These are always estimated from the data, and lie between -0.5 and 0.5 PRF. An ambiguity estimator module (estamb) is under development and can be selectively turned on in the future for processing post-2001 ERS2 data.
